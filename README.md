Bindable Properties and Events
How do you know to which Properties or Events of HTML Elements you may bind? You can basically bind to all Properties and Events - a good idea is to console.log()  the element you're interested in to see which properties and events it offers.

Important: For events, you don't bind to onclick but only to click (=> (click)).

The MDN (Mozilla Developer Network) offers nice lists of all properties and events of the element you're interested in. Googling for YOUR_ELEMENT properties  or YOUR_ELEMENT events  should yield nice results.

Important: FormsModule is Required for Two-Way-Binding!
Important: For Two-Way-Binding (covered in the next lecture) to work, you need to enable the ngModel  directive. This is done by adding the FormsModule  to the imports[]  array in the AppModule.

You then also need to add the import from @angular/forms  in the app.module.ts file:

import { FormsModule } from '@angular/forms';
